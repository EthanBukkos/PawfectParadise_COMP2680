                <p>Meet Willow! I am so glad we adopted her! My family thought we'd never get another cat, but when we met
                    Willow we instantly loved her. Thank you, Pawfect Paradise!</p>

                <p>This choatic pup is named Loki. Pawfect warned me of his mischievous nature, but they assured me how loving
                    he is. They were right! He is my first puppy and he keeps me busy. I appreciate Pawfect Paradise for introducing
                    me to him.</p>

                <p>Here's Gracie! This living vacuum cleaner is my best friend. I adopted her a year ago and I don't know what I'd do
                without her. Thanks, Pawfect Paradise!</p>

                <p>This crazy looking cat is named Dexi. She is playful until company comes over. She always runs and hides! It took a
                whole month for her to warm up to me after adopting her! Well worth it!</p>
